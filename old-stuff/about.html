    <h1>About me and this blog</h1>
    <p>
    My name is Ã…smund. I'm currently a PhD student in what I would call
    Computational Physics, in the Department of Energy and
    Process Engineering at <a href="http://ntnu.edu">NTNU</a> in Trondheim, Norway. I'll let my 
    <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/asmunder">PhD homepage</a> take it from here if you're interested.

    As a scientist, I often find myself doing things that could probably be
    interesting to others, but that isn't readily publishable in the scientific
    literature. Hopefully this blog can be a channel for such things. I'll also post
    things that are unrelated to my scientific work, but still of a technical
    nature.

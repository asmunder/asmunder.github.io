Inspired by the recent revelations that VW has been cheating on NOx emissions
tests, I thought I would put together a simple histogram of car CO2 emissions as
reported by car manufacturers. This is done with data taken from
http://www.carpages.co.uk/co2/ for all cars available in the UK today.
I picked those with emissions between 94 g/km and 114 g/km, which gave 1 285
model/engine combinations. Without further ado:

Notice those peaks? The two big ones are at 99 g/km and at 109 g/km. Now of
course the final emissions comes from a tradeoff made in the car ECU map between 
horsepower, fuel efficiency and emissions, but it still looks a bit fishy that 99
g/km is the optimal tradeoff point for so many more cars than e.g. 102 g/km is.
And we do know there's a lot of [fudging going on][transenv] with these measurements.
